                        <h2>Abstract:</h2>

                        <p style="text-align: left;">Herein we present a “value spreading system” (VSS) that mimics the basic economic and trading principles in an environment of a finite number of people that grows infinitely in a finite period of time (cycles)*. In contrast with the current and conventional economic system, we eliminate all the factors that yield earn opportunities unequal, and we provide a strict and robust mechanism in which earn opportunities are determined by impartial factors that cannot be influenced through individual initiation, such as time and collective behaviour. Initial investments can be sought as the entrance fee the user needs to pay to take advantage of the system and are fixed for all the participants which  equal priority to everyone. Moreover, the system ensures that every “initial investment” is able to earn, that is, making a user from (spender)* to (earner)*, given that the user continues to exploit the VSS.</p>

                        <hr>
                        <h2>VSS Components:</h2>

                        <p style="text-align: left;">The VSS can be better understood by introducing its basic components in a hierarchical order of importance.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Bricks:</h4>
                        
                        <p style="text-align: left;">For such systems to be executed smoothly and with minimal friction, the absent of a third-party validator is mandatory. Any third-party validation process, such as the blockchain’s unpredictable transaction time, will render the system unable to provide equal control over the users timing during their participation. The system’s natural demand for instant transaction validation gives rise to the need of a virtual local currency that can be purchased in advance, used and redeemed at any time. (Participants are encouraged to purchase the virtual currency beforehand). Bricks is the name of the virtual currency that is used for the purposes of the system. It can be purchased using ether from the “buy bricks” section, and it can be redeemed from the user’s account for ether at any given moment. Then, the ether will be transferred to the user’s wallet automatically. By using their pre-purchased bricks, users can ensure that no uneven latency will occur during their activity on the website. 
                          Moreover, the amount of purchased bricks can give a fairly accurate insight as to how many users will likely be using the system in the future. With that information we are able to dynamically change the values of the system’s variables so that they can support the population that is expected to join a cycle yet maintain the benefits of high cycle traffic. This is achieved with linear equations that the variables of the system follow with absolute value of slope less than 1.</p>
                        <br><br>
                          <h4>Floaters:</h4>
                        
                          <p style="text-align: left;">Two variables exist that when summed together give a value for the number of floaters (#floaters)*. The number of spenders of the previous cycle (#spenders_of_pervious_cycle)* + the number of people that possess enough bricks to join a cycle (#floaters_with_bricks). By summing those two variables and thus calculating the #floaters, the potential number of participants at any given moment can be estimated.</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <h4>Cycles:</h4>
                        
                        <p style="text-align: left;"> Now it’s time to introduce another important component of the system: cycles. Cycles are defined as periods of time that repeat on a standard basis for the purposes of the system. The duration of a cycle is determined a few seconds prior to the initialization of a cycle by the amount of people who are likely to join the cycle, that is, the number of floaters. The duration of a cycle is calculated with the following formula:
                        <br><br>
                        length_of_cycles_in_hours = 0.001*#floaters+144
                        
                        <br><br>
                        *the length of cycles grows infinitely. The whole process is completely automatic.
                        <br><br>
                        The distance between the end of a cycle and the beginning of the next is exactly the same as the length of the cycle that ended. For example, a Cycle can run for 160 hours, and the next cycle will begin 160 hours after the end of the running cycle.
                        
                        
                        Users can exploit the VSS by entering a Cycle at any given moment while the cycle is running. Cycles’ repetitive nature enables the system to provide perks and benefits for everyone, given that users manually participate in one or more cycles. Through this process, the VSS allows users to gain control over their participation and ensures that they earn back on their original entrance fee one way or another. For users to participate in a cycle, they need to pay the entrance fee of the cycle which is paid in bricks. Thus, the user becomes part of the Display mechanism of the system.</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <h4>Display mechanism:</h4>
                        
                        <p style="text-align: left;">The Display mechanism is the mechanism that uses the system during a cycle to spread the value around individuals that are participating. A “Display page” exists where one user at a time is displayed. The value spreading is caused by the conditions of entry. When new users join the cycle by paying their entrance fee, they automatically give a deposit to the user displayed on the “Display page”.  A Deposit is a specific amount of bricks that are given to the displayed user by other users that join the cycle at the moment of his/her display. Each user has an encrypted ID that is unique for each cycle and links his/her account with their display Hash on the display system. Through this method, no one can know if they are displayed or not. This ensures that the VSS cannot be biased by purposefully calling individuals to enter the cycle at the moment of someone’s display, hence, allowing objective earnings by the users.</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <h4>Who is displayed and for how long?</h4>
                        
                        <p style="text-align: left;"> At this point, a question arises. Who is displayed and for how long? Displayed users have a position in a queue of display according to the amount of people that were already participating in the cycle before their point of entry. For example, if 50 people were already participating in a cycle before someone’s entry, after he pays the entrance fee and automatically gives a deposit to the displayed user, he will reserve the position 51. Whenever someone’s remaining time on the display page expires, the next one in order, takes his/her place. In addition, the remaining time on the display page of each user is determined by the traffic of the cycle at his/her point of entry to the cycle. Whenever a user joins a cycle, the system calculates the number of users that joined 5 minutes before their point of entry. In this manner, individuals reserve their time of display according to the following equation:</p>

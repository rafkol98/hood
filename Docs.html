                        <h2>Abstract:</h2>

                        <p style="text-align: left;">Herein we present a “value spreading system” (VSS) that mimics the basic economic and trading principles in an environment of a finite number of people that grows infinitely in a finite period of time (cycles)*. In contrast with the current and conventional economic system, we eliminate all the factors that yield earn opportunities unequal. We provide a strict and robust mechanism in which earn opportunities are determined by impartial factors that cannot be influenced through individual initiation, such as time and collective behaviour. Initial investments can be sought as the entrance fee the user needs to pay to take advantage of the system and are fixed for all the participants which equals priority to everyone. Moreover, the system ensures that every “initial investment” is able to earn, that is, making a user from (spender)* to (earner)*, given that the user continues to exploit the VSS.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: left;">The VSS can be better understood by introducing its basic components in a hierarchical order of importance.</p>

Any third-party validation process will render the system unable to provide equal control over the users timing during their participation. The system’s natural demand for instant transaction validation gives rise to the need of a virtual local currency that can be purchased in advance, used and redeemed at any time (participants are encouraged to purchase the virtual currency beforehand). Bricks is the name of the virtual currency that is used for the purposes of the system. It can be purchased using ether from the “buy bricks” section, and it can be redeemed from the user’s account for ether at any given moment. Then, the ether will be transferred to the user’s wallet automatically. By using their pre-purchased bricks, users can be sure that no uneven latency will occur during their activity on the website.</p>

                                            Now it’s time to introduce another important component of the system - Cycles. Cycles are defined as periods of time that repeat on a standard basis for the purposes of the system. The duration of a Cycle is dynamic, and it is calculated based on the number of floaters a few seconds before a new Cycle begins.
                                            <br><br>The duration of a cycle is calculated with the following formula:
                                            <br><br></p>
                                        <p class="formulas">length_of_cycles_in_hours = 0.001*#floaters+144</p>

                                        <br><br>
                                        <p style="text-align: left;">
                                            *The whole process is completely automatic.
                                            <br><br>
                                            The time difference between the end of a Cycle and the beginning of the next one is exactly the same as the length of the Cycle that just ended. For example, a Cycle can run for 160 hours, and the next cycle will begin 160 hours after the end of the running Cycle. Users can exploit the VSS by entering a Cycle at any given moment while the Cycle is running. Cycles’ repetitive nature enables the system to provide perks for everyone, given that a user participates in one or more cycles. Through this process, the VSS allows users to gain control over their participation and ensures that they earn back on their original entrance fee one way or another. For users to participate in a cycle, they need to pay the entrance fee of the cycle which is paid in bricks. Thus, the user becomes part of the display mechanism of the system.
                                        
                                        </p>

                                        <p style="text-align: left;"> 
                                            The system uses the display mechanism during a Cycle to spread bricks across individuals that are participating.
                                            When a user decides to join a Cycle, he sees an encrypted ID of the user who is currently displayed (first in the queue).
                                            The spreading of the bricks is caused by the conditions of entry. When new users join the Cycle by paying their entrance fee, they automatically give a deposit to the user displayed. A Deposit is a specific amount of bricks that are earned by the displayed user when other users join the Cycle. Each user has an encrypted ID that is unique for each cycle and it is linked with their account. Using this method, no one can know if they are displayed or not. This ensures that the VSS cannot be biased by intentionally calling individuals to enter the Cycle at the moment of someone’s display, hence, allowing objective earnings by the users.
                                            
                                        </p>   <br><br>
                                        <h4>Who is displayed and for how long?</h4>

                                        <p style="text-align: left;">
                                            At this point, a question arises. Who is displayed and for how long? Displayed users have a position in the queue of display according to the amount of people that were already participating in the cycle before their point of entry. For example, if 50 people were already in the Cycle, a new participant will reserve the position 51. Whenever someone’s remaining time on the display page expires, the next one in order, takes their place. Whenever a user joins a cycle, the system calculates the number of users that joined 5 minutes before their point of entry.
                                        </p>           <br><br>
                                            In this manner, individuals reserve their time of display according to the following equation:</p>
                                        <div class="formulas">
                                            unit = 3.5

                                           Users are displayed for infinite amount of time until they get their first deposit. When that happens, they are allowed an extra display time which is calculated using the abovementioned formula.
                                           <br><br> The system ensures that everyone displayed will receive at least one deposit and thus provides the user with an opportunity to earn more than they initially invested (entrance fee).

                                            Now that a detailed introduction on the idea behind VSS has been outlined, it is important to understand two further components of the system. These are earners and spenders and they characterise participants according to their financial situation at the end of a cycle.<br><br>
                                            Earners are users that receive one or more deposits. Spenders, however, receive zero deposits during or by the end of a cycle. In other words, spenders are users that did not get the chance to be displayed. Earners are rewarded with bricks by the deposits of other users that join the cycle. Spenders are rewarded by the system by receiving a free-entrance ticket. The ticket can be used to enter any of the following cycles without the need to pay the entrance fee. Accordingly, spenders can continue to exploit the system until they receive at least one deposit and thus becoming earners, without the need to repay the entrance fee.

                                            All involved individuals benefit from the repetition of Cycles. Each Cycle allows infinite growth of its participants while rewarding early involved individuals by significantly increasing their chance of becoming earners (as they have a better display queue order). <br><br>Each user has the ability of entering a Cycle at any moment they believe will benefit them the most based on the traffic indicator*.

                                            Users who join the Cycle when the traffic is low are rewarded with more display time.
                                            Users that decide to enter the Cycle at high traffic benefit from the fact that the Cycle is speeding up and their chance of display is higher even if the queue is long. 
                                            <br><br>Users that fail to become earners are rewarded with a free entrance ticket and the spenders precedence*. Current spenders have priority in any of the following Cycles and can repeatedly enter without paying again, until they eventually become earners. This ensures the creation of a balanced economic environment where everyone become earners.

Users can increase their chances of benefitting from the Cycle’s traffic by entering as early as possible. This provides them with lower queue order and thus increases their display chances. However, because the speed of the queue is determined by the display time of each user, each moment of entering the Cycle has the potential to justify the user. Therefore, joining a Cycle at any moment can eventually turn a user into earner.</p>

                                    <p style="text-align: left;">Apart from the free entrance ticket that all spenders receive at the end of a Cycle, spenders have another perk: spenders’ precedence. Spenders’ precedence is a window of time at the beginning of a Cycle in which ONLY ticket-holder spenders can enter the Cycle. The length of this window is measured in minutes, and it depends on the number of spenders of the last Cycle. It is calculated with the following formula:</p>
                                    <p class="formulas">spenders_precedence = 0.001*#spenders_of_last_cycle_only + 10</p>
            
                                    <p style="text-align: left;"><br><br>*after the spender precedence ends, ticket-holder spenders who didn’t manage to join yet can still join the Cycle without precedence (given that the maximum number of spenders hasn’t been reached yet). 
                                        <br><br>*if the maximum number of allowed spenders (#max_spenders) is reached before the end of spenders’ precedence, then spenders’ precedence ends, and new participants can join the Cycle.
                                        <br><br>As the values of the variables max_spenders and spenders_precedence rise (rise of #floaters) the time_of_display declines. This is due to the multiplier which declines as the number of floaters rise.
                                        This relationship ensures that the value of the variables max_spenders and spenders_precedence rises to accommodate spenders according to the demand, whilst maintaining enough time for new participants to become earners from their first time of using the VSS. Specifically, the worst-case scenario in terms of how many hours spenders can occupy from the length of the Cycle is calculated with the following equation:
                                        
                                    </p>

                                        .y=spenders_precedence/5<br>
                                        .v=#max_spenders/(y/5)<br><br>

                                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                                        The numbers of the variables in any case ensure that the maximum hours occupied by the spenders never exceed 50% of the total Cycle duration.  <br><br></p>

                                    <p style="text-align: left;">In addition, another simple yet important mechanism of the system needs to be introduced: the randomizer. Every three hours a random participant is selected from the queue and is placed below the participant that is displayed at the moment. This, along with the free entrance ticket spenders receive, serves as an equaliser to the odds of late involved individuals against early involved individuals. The randomizer raises the chances of late involved individuals that have a low chance of being displayed.</p>

                                        As it is obvious, participants that receive two or more deposits have practically earned more than their entrance fee. However, participants that earn only one deposit are still considered earners for the purposes of the VSS. <br><br>
                                        Yet, since the worth of a single deposit is less than the entrance fee, those participants practically didn’t earn back more than their entrance fee. This is balanced out with the implementation of a bonus mechanism for the VSS. Since everyone’s display time begins to countdown from the moment they receive their first deposit, everyone that was displayed will receive at least one deposit. In a situation where a Cycle has a lot of traffic, a participant becoming earner with just one deposit can be considered rare. As Cycle traffic cumulates, the chances of someone receiving just a single deposit are significantly reduced. The factor that is responsible for the occurrence of such cases is the collective behavior which is nearly unpredictable. In the case of high traffic cumulation, participants that became earners with a single deposit are highly rewarded by the bonus mechanism of the VSS.<br><br>
                                        Cycles consist of 5 fixed checkpoints which are achieved based on the number of people who joined.<br><br>

                                        20-49 participants – 5% of the grand sum of money (including service commission) <br><br>
                                        50-99 participants – 10% of the grand sum of money (including service commission) <br><br>
                                        100-169 participants – 15% of the grand sum of money (including service commission) <br><br>
                                        170 or more – 20% of the grand sum of money (including service commission) <br><br>
                                        </div>

                                        <br><br>The percentage of the grand sum of money is then divided amongst the number of participants that got just a single deposit. This can create a situation where single deposit users can earn massive amount of bonus. This entirely depends on the number of single deposit earners and ultimately the unpredictable collective behaviour.

                                    <p style="text-align: left;">With all that said, the VSS is a system which is based on growth. The increase in the number of participants in a Cycle entails their maximal benefit by at least preserving the chance of earning back more than what they initially paid. Any fixed numbers, for example equation slopes, traffic indicator etc. can always be adjusted according to data from a real-life scenario. This is a prototype in which all numbers were set based on research and estimation. Our team is willing to change any number that do not correspond to the feedback received by the participants.</p>
